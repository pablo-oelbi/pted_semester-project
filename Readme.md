## Research Questions
<!-- (50-60 words) -->
The purpose of this research is to investigate the relationship between the distance from home to the train station and the mode of transportation used to get to the station. The study will use trajectory data to examine this relationship and identify potential patterns and factors that influence the choice of transportation mode. To achieve this aim, the following methodological research questions will be addressed:
1. What statistical method should be used to analyse the relationship between the distance between home and station and the mode of transport used to get to the station in the trajectory data?
2. How should the distance between home and station be measured to accurately analyse the relationship between the distance and the mode of transport used?
3. How should the means of transport be categorised to effectively analyse the relationship between the distance and the means of transport used?
## Results / products
<!-- What do you expect, anticipate? -->
The analysis of the trajectory data is expected to provide valuable insights into the relationship between the distance from home to the train station and the mode of transportation used. It is expected that the analysis will reveal patterns and trends in the data, such as temporal or spatial variations in the relationship between distance and mode used. Finally, it is expected that the analysis will highlight potential confounding variables that may influence the relationship between distance and mode used.
## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->
The data will consist of GPS trajectory data collected from individuals traveling to nearest train stations. The dataset will include information on the mode of transportation used (e.g., walking, biking, e-bike, car, public transit), as well as the distance between the individual's home and the train station and in what time this is made.
